# Odin Rock Paper Scissors

This is the repo for my third project in The Odin Project's Foundation path. The goal of this project is to create a rock paper scissors game played in the console. During the revisit assignment, I have also added extra styling for more interactive gameplay as well as refactor the game logic.

After finishing this project, I have reached beginner levels in JavaScript.
